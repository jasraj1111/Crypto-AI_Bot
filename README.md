### AI-Driven Crypto Trading Bot with On-Chain Sentiment Analysis
## Project Overview
This project integrates AI-driven market prediction with on-chain sentiment analysis, enabling a fully automated crypto trading bot that adapts to market conditions in real-time. The AI model will analyze historical price data, social media sentiment, and on-chain transactions to predict price movements and execute trades securely through smart contracts on DeFi platforms.

# Tech Stack
â€¢	AI/ML & Data Processing: Python (TensorFlow/PyTorch, Scikit-learn, NLP models)
â€¢	Blockchain & Smart Contracts: Solidity (Ethereum, Polygon), Hardhat/Foundry
â€¢	Data Sources: Web3.js, The Graph, Twitter API, Reddit API, Telegram API, DeFi Protocols (Uniswap, Aave, Compound)
â€¢	Frontend & Backend: Next.js (React), Tailwind CSS, Node.js, MongoDB

# How It Works
1. On-Chain & Off-Chain Data Collection
The bot gathers real-time data from: âœ… On-Chain Data (via Web3 & The Graph API)
â€¢	DeFi Transactions (large buys/sells on Uniswap, Aave, Compound)
â€¢	Smart Contract Events (liquidations, token movements)
â€¢	Whale Wallet Movements (monitoring big traders' actions)
âœ… Off-Chain Data (via APIs & Web Scraping)
â€¢	Social Media Sentiment Analysis (Twitter, Reddit, Telegram)
â€¢	Crypto News Headlines (via RSS feeds & AI-based topic modeling)

2. AI-Powered Sentiment & Market Analysis
ðŸ“Œ The AI model processes collected data to predict market trends using: ðŸ”¹ Natural Language Processing (NLP) â€“ Detects bullish/bearish sentiment from news & social media. ðŸ”¹ Time-Series Analysis (LSTMs, ARIMA, Transformers) â€“ Predicts price movements based on historical patterns. ðŸ”¹ Anomaly Detection (Isolation Forest, Autoencoders) â€“ Detects pump-and-dump schemes & fraud.
The AI assigns a market confidence score (0-100) indicating whether to buy, sell, or hold based on sentiment & trading signals.

3. Smart Contract Execution & Trading Automation
ðŸ“Œ When a trade signal is generated, the bot executes it using: âœ… Smart Contracts for trade execution (on-chain orders with gas optimization). âœ… Automated Portfolio Balancing (reallocates assets between different cryptos). âœ… Risk Management Module:
â€¢	Auto Stop-Loss & Take-Profit Orders
â€¢	Liquidation risk alerts for DeFi lending positions âœ… Flash Loan Arbitrage (optional): Detects and executes arbitrage across multiple DEXs (Uniswap, PancakeSwap, SushiSwap).

4. User Dashboard & Control Panel
ðŸ“Œ A Next.js-based frontend for users to: âœ… View AI-generated insights (market trends, sentiment scores). âœ… Customize risk tolerance & trading preferences. âœ… Manually approve or reject AI-generated trades (if desired). âœ… Track portfolio performance in real-time.
